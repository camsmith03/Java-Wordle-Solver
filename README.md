# Java-Wordle-Solver
Solves the daily wordle with java using process of elimination with a five letter word text file.

Very basic code, first time uploading on github so apologies for any errors or bugs involved.
Plans to improve UX are in the future, but as of right now, not much will change except 
removing past wordles from the list.
